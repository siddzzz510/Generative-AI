Generative AI (Gen AI) is a branch of artificial intelligence that creates new content such as text, images, music, or code by learning patterns from large datasets. Using advanced deep learning models like transformers (e.g., GPT) and diffusion models, it generates outputs that mimic human creativity and context. It powers applications like chatbots, image synthesis, text completion, and video generation, revolutionizing industries with its ability to produce high-quality, original, and contextually relevant content.
